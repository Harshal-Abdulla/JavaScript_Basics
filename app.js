//const is like let but it make it constant and cant vary the value/overwrite
//opeartors
const a =2
const b = 15
//arithmetic operators
console.log(a+b)

console.log(a-b)
console.log(a*b)
console.log(a/b)
console.log(a%b) //reminder
console.log(a ** b) //exponent = 2^15
//assignment operators
let c = 0

c++ //c+1
c += 7 //increment by 7
c *=5 //multiply by 5
c /= 3  //divide by 3
//line by line interpretation occurs so it overwrites the value before that line
console.log(c)
